# simple-sql-parser supported SQL overview

[simple-sql-parser home](index.html)

This page has more details on the supported SQL in simple-sql-parser.

See the [simple-sql-parser test cases](test_cases.html) page for
examples.

# Select lists

Supports value expressions, aliases with optional 'as'.

Doesn't support 'select * as (a,b,c) from t' yet.

# Set quantifiers on select

Supports 'select distinct' and explicit 'select all'.

# From clause

* aliases
* subqueries
* functions
* joins
    - natural
    - inner
    - left/right/full outer
    - cross
    - on expressions
    - using lists
    - lateral

# Group by clause

Supports value expressions, group by (), cube, rollup, grouping
parentheses and grouping sets with nested grouping expressions.

# Order by clause

Supports value expressions, asc/desc and nulls first/last.

# Offset and fetch

Supports 'offset n rows' and 'fetch first n rows only'.

# Set operators

Union, except, intersect + all/distinct and corresponding.

# Table value constructor

For example: values (1,2),(3,4).

# Explicit table

For example: 'table t', which is shorthand for 'select * from t'.

# Value expressions

The value expressions type and parser is used in many contexts,
including:

* select lists;
* where clause expressions;
* group by clause expressions;
* having clause expressions;
* order by clause expressions;
* offset and fetch clause expressions;
* table value constructors.

This doesn't follow the ANSI Standards, which have separate grammars
for most of these.

The supported value expressions include:

* basic string literals in single quotes (escapes and other string
  literal syntaxes coming soon)
* number literals: digits.digitse+-exp
* explicitly typed literal, e.g. int '3'
* binary operators
    - comparisons: = != <> <= >= < >
    - arithmetic: + - / * %
    - logic: and, or
    - bitwise: ^ & |
    - string: ||, like, not like
    - other: overlaps, is similar to, is not similar too, is distinct
    from, is not distinct from
* prefix unary operators
    - +, -
    - not
    - ~
* postfix unary
    - is null, is not null
    - is true, is not true, is false, is not false, is unknown, is not unknown

Some of the precedence and associativity parsing of operators isn't
completely correct at the moment. This mainly affects unary prefix and
postfix operator precedence.

* other operators
    - extract (extract(day from dt))
    - position (position string1 in string2)
    - substring (substring(x from 2 for 4))
    - convert (convert(string using conversion))
    - translate (translate(string using translation))
    - overlay (overlay (string placing embedded_string from start for
      length))
    - trim (trim(leading '_' from s))
    - between (a between 1 and 5)
    - in list (a in (1,2,3,4))
    - cast (cast(a as int))
* subqueries
    - in subquery
    - any/some/all
    - exists
* case expressions
* parentheses
* quoted and unquoted identifiers
* a.b qualified identifiers
* \*, a.\*
* functions: f(a,b)
* aggregates: agg(distinct a order by b)
* window functions: sum(x) over (partition by y order by z)
  plus some explicit frame support (same as in postgres 9.3)
* row constructors, e.g. where (a,b) = any (select a,b from t)
* ? used in parameterized queries
